# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project is a heart disease prediction system that leverages a hybrid machine learning model, combining Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression for enhanced accuracy. Trained on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, the model predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on key health parameters. The system is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface where users can input medical details and receive real-time predictions. A validation check ensures that the "Result Display" button is only enabled once all inputs are provided. Additionally, the project integrates data visualization to present insights from the dataset through graphical representations. A report generation feature is included using FPDF, allowing users to download a detailed PDF report containing their input details, prediction results, and model insights.

The project is built using Python with essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, while PyCharm and Jupyter Notebook were used for development. Future improvements include enhancing model performance with additional datasets, integrating cloud-based patient record storage, and adding a chatbot for assistance. This project serves as an efficient, interactive, and portable tool for heart disease risk assessment, making machine learning-powered healthcare predictions accessible to users.
